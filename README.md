Camera Triggering & VectorNav Data Aquisition ROS
====================

The system is built on Raspberry pi 3. 
Triggering is controlled from Mission Planner (ARDUPILOT)'s 'trigger camera now' via FlightController using GPIO connection.
In the demo [1], Sony Alpha 5100 is chosen but every kind of camera is possible to be used.

For VectorNav driver, [2] is used and installation details can be seen in [2].
