Camera Triggering & VectorNav Data Aquisition ROS
====================

The system is built on Raspberry pi 3. 
Triggering is controlled from Mission Planner (ARDUPILOT)'s 'trigger camera now' via FlightController using GPIO connection.
In the demo, Sony Alpha 5100 is chosen but every kind of camera is possible to be used.

For VectorNav driver, [1] is used.
